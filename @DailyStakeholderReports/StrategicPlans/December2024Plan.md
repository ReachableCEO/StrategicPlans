## Introduction to December 2024 Plan

The below list represents my exit from COO (and all reporting functions) critical path by December 21st. 

The goal, is that after December 21st, I will invert my weekly time allocation :
- Current time allocation: 90% COO, 10% CTO
- Desired time allocation: 90% CTO, 10% COO

Redmine will be the data oracle to determine if that goal is successful.
